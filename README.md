SNHU CS305: Software Security

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

	As an employee of Global Rain, we specialize in custom software design and development. Our client, Artemis Financial, is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. The financial plans include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. Recently they decided they wanted to modernize their operations and want to use the most current and effective software security. 

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

	Some vulnerabilities identified within the areas of security include input validation, APIs, cryptography, code error, and code quality. Ensuring a secure code is important because the livelihood of the entire system is at stake otherwise. Software security adds reliability to the name of the organization. It also keeps customer loyalty as they feel safe knowing their data is also protected. 

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

	Assessing the vulnerability had its moments of complication but we were still able to overcome the hiccups. Getting the static testing was not an issue. Integrating the maven testing and generating the dependency report was fine. The information in the report however was all a foreign language to me. 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

	After running the dependency report, we were then able to code in the suppressions. Suppressing the vulnerabilities we were able to have a clearer report. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

	I utilized tools such as OWASP and Oracle to aid when working in the CMD terminal with Keystore. Reading back in the Iron-Clad textbook also helped when referencing what safety techniques to keep in mind. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

	I would show employers how I successfully ran a dependency report and was able to suppress vulnerabilities. In addition, I will also show how I was able to determine some of the vulnerabilities by manually reading through the code.
